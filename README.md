# OpenAI GPT-4 Chatbot with Tkinter GUI

This project is a chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate responses. The chatbot is interfaced with a Tkinter GUI, making it easy to interact with.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python 3.6 and above. You also need the following Python packages, which can be installed via pip:

- tkinter
- openai

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/gpt4-chatbot.git

Running the Chatbot
To run the chatbot, navigate to the directory containing the project files and run:

python3 locutorium.py


You'll also need to provide your OpenAI API key. This should be stored in a file named Tk_key.txt in the same directory as the Python script.

The chatbot will start writing in Latin and you can begin conversing with it. As long as you write in latin it should continue in that language. Type your message into the input box and press Enter or click the Send button to send it. The chatbot's response will appear in the chat window.

Quitting the Chat
You can end the chat session by clicking the Quit button or closing the chat window. The word 'VALE' is used as a keyword for quitting the chat in the script.
